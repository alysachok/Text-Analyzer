# Text Readability Analyzer

## Description

Originally developed in C as part of the CS50 Harvard University curriculum, this project has evolved into a React-Typescript application to provide a user-friendly interface. The Text Readability Analyzer uses the Coleman-Liau index to determine the U.S. grade level necessary for understanding a piece of text. This tool can be valuable for educators, writers, and anyone looking to ensure their writing is accessible and understandable. By analyzing the number of letters, words, and sentences, it offers clear insight into text complexity.
